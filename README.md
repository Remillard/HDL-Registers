About HDLRegs
=============

HDLRegs is an open-source HDL register file generator written in the Python programming language. It takes a register specification in JSON format, 
and generates the following output files:

  * VHDL package
  * Synthesizable VHDL component
  * C header
  * HTML documentation

Register Specification
======================

The register structure for a given module (e.g. UART, timer etc.) is specified in a text-file formatted according to the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).
Here is an example of a very simple register specification, which contains only one register:

    {
      "name"        : "adc_interface",
      "description" : "ADC interface",
      "width"       : 32,
      "registers":
        [
            {
              "name"          : "adc_control",
              "description"   : "ADC global control register",
              "access"        : "read-write",
              "addressOffset" : "0x100",
              "reset"         : "0xFFFFFFFF",
              "fields"        :
                  [
                    {
                        "name"        : "reset",
                        "description" : "reset ADC interface",
                        "bitOffset"   : 31,
                        "bitWidth"    : 1,
                        "reset"       : 0
                    }                            
                  ]          
            }
        ]
    }    

Usage
=====

To generate the output files from the JSON specification, execute the hdlregs.py script with the path to the JSON register specification as an argument. e.g.:
    
    python hdlregs.py example/example.json

Compatibility
=============

The VHDL register file component generated by HDLRegs has a generic host processor interface, which consists of the following ports:

    clk     : in  std_logic;                     -- system clock
    rst     : in  std_logic;                     -- synchronous, high-active
    addr    : in  std_logic_vector(31 downto 0); -- read/write address
    cs      : in  std_logic;                     -- chip select
    rnw     : in  std_logic;                     -- read (1) or write (0)
    datain  : in  std_logic_vector(31 downto 0); -- write data
    dataout : out std_logic_vector(31 downto 0); -- read data
    
VHDL adapter components are provided for connecting an HDLRegs-generated register file to Xilinx IPIF and AXI4-Lite interfaces.
